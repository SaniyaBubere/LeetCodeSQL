name is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table gives information about the name of a country, the continent to which it belongs, its area, the population, and its GDP value.
 

A country is big if:

it has an area of at least three million (i.e., 3000000 km2), or
it has a population of at least twenty-five million (i.e., 25000000).
Write a solution to find the name, population, and area of the big countries.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

-- Solution

-- Selecting the name, population, and area from the 'world' table
SELECT name, population, area

-- Filtering the rows where either area is greater than or equal to 3,000,000 square kilometers
-- or population is greater than or equal to 25,000,000 people
FROM world

-- The WHERE clause specifies the conditions for filtering
WHERE area >= 3000000 OR population >= 25000000;
